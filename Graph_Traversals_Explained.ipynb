    "\n",
    "Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the nodes in a graph by systematically visiting as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It operates on both directed and undirected graphs and can be implemented using recursion or an explicit stack data structure.\n",
